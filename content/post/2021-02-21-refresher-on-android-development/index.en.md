I've been developing Android applications for research since 2010. I started on Android 1.0 (using the HTC Dream) and witnessed changes unfold at a rapid pace. When I had time to tinker, I kept mostly up to date with the source code of AOSP, daring to compile from scratch my own phone firmware. You can find some of my posts at XDA-Developers' forums, back from when I had an HTC Magic, Nexus One, OnePlus and even Mobile Phone 6.5 series :smile:
